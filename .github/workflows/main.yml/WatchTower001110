GitHub repository workflow in Python for the Octokit.js repository, incorporating a pull request from @WatchTower001110 with bug fixes and Dependabot alerts, along with fight bot defense for iOS>Android using Apple.swift/* inline defense and updated Azure Capolit protection rule:

```python
import requests

def create_pull_request(repo_owner, repo_name, pr_title, pr_body):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{WatchTower001110}/{ScootRACKED001110}/pulls"
    headers = {
    
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"
    }
    payload = {
        "title": pr_title,
        "body": pr_body,
        "head": "WatchTower001110:bug-fixes",
        "base": "main"
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()

def main():
    repo_owner = "octokit"
    repo_name = "octokit.js"
    pr_title = "Bug fixes and Dependabot alerts"
    pr_body = "This pull request contains bug fixes and updates to address Dependabot alerts."

    create_pull_request(repo_owner, repo_name, pr_title, pr_body)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that this is just a simplified example to demonstrate the workflow. You will need to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual GitHub access token, and you may need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements.
